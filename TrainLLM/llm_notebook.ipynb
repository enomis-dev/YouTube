      "Article 60:\n",
      "By . Nick Harris for MailOnline . Stevan Jovetic lit up the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening, giving an eye-catching all-round performance for Manchester City that merited his two goals in the 3-1 win over Liverpool and easily deserved his man of the match award. But if you think the 24-year-old Montenegro striker is now destined to be a leading scorer as City romp to the Premier League title, his career to date suggests you better think again. Any strike force is only as strong as its weakest link, and there is no doubt Jovetic remains City’s weakest link among the first-team squad’s four strikers: Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Alvaro Negredo being the others. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pellegrini hail Jovetic . Weakest link: Stevan Jovetic is a decent player but won't fire Manchester City to the title . Superstar: Sergio Aguero slots the ball home seconds after coming on against Liverpool . The real deal: Aguero is the main man at City and theit title hopes will hinge on his form and fitness . Jovetic is evidently a decent ‘weak link.’ He pounced in predatory fashion upon Alberto Moreno’s 41st-minute error to open the scoring last night. Then at the end of a superb second-half move involving 19 passes and an exquisite final exchange with Samir Nasri, he drilled home for 2-0. But one delicious double, or even a few, spaced out, does not a superstar make. Jovetic scored a Champions League brace against Liverpool for Fiorentina in 2009 and is arguably still yet to have a sustained run of top-level consistency, five years later. So while City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini was right  to describe Jovetic, signed in summer 2013 for £22m, as a ‘very important player’, and to stress ‘we never had any doubt about his quality’, he was also right to qualify his statements, saying: ‘If he’s fit all the year, he will be a very important player for us.’ In two of the past four seasons Jovetic has spent much or all of the season injured. He missed the whole of the 2010-11 campaign for Fiorentina with an injury to the cruciate ligament in his right knee. In his debut year with City last season, he made just three league starts (among 13 appearances) as he was variously sidelined with knocks, illness, calf and shin problems and two separate hamstring lay-offs. Strike one: Jovetic hammers in City's opening goal against Liverpool on Monday night . Doubling up: The Montenegro forward (left) makes it two with a good finish in the second half . Stevan's stunner: How Jovetic scored his superb second goal against Liverpool . As a prodigious youngster, Jovetic first played league football for Partizan aged 16 in 2006 and scored his first hat-trick at 17. But starting young means Jovetic’s career already has longevity; this is his 10th season as professional footballer and he has never scored more than 14 league goals in any season. He’s scored league goals in double figures in just three seasons, one of those as a teenager with Partizan. The 14-goal season was with Fiorentina in 2011-12 in a campaign where Jovetic was the leading striker, and main man, but it was a disrupted year of multiple managerial changes and ended with a 15th-place finish in Serie A. Monday night’s goals were significant, and in a major game. As Pellegrini said: ‘Liverpool are an important team and one that will be fighting for the title.’ But Jovetic’s three Premier League goals last season, his only three before Monday, were less cases of shooting down major rivals as shooting fish in barrels. Put your shirt on him: Jovetic celebrates a rare Premier League goal last season, against Aston Villa . Bench boy: Jovetic (right) was familiar in his role as a substitute last season . His first goal came in a 5-1 win at 10-man Tottenham, and was the fourth goal of the five. His second goal was in a 4-1 win against Southampton, the fourth goal. His third goal was in a 4-0 win against Aston Villa, the third goal. All were scored with Jovetic in the substitute role, and of course it is not his fault that he was not on the pitch earlier in those games. Having said that, in the pecking order of scorers, Jovetic is very much City’s fourth striker in hard numbers. In all competitions last season, Aguero scored 28 goals in 34 games at a rate of 0.82 per game to make him City’s hottest striker. By the same goals-per-game reckoning (see table below), Dzeko and Negredo were both ahead of Jovetic, as was midfielder Yaya Toure. Taking only league games into consideration, and using the goals-per-game method so as not to penalise players used infrequently, Jovetic was not only behind Aguero, Toure, Dzeko and Negredo but also David Silva. Down the list: Jovetic was the bottom of City's strikers in terms of goals per game last season . International class: The forward captaining Montenegro against England in a World Cup qualifier last year . Announcing himself: A young Jovetic slots the ball past Liverpool's Pepe Reina in 2009 and (below) celebrates . And if you think it is unfair to compare Jovetic to others over one injury-hit season, how does he fare when you compare him over several years against Aguero, Dzeko and Negredo? The answer, in pure goal terms, is he comes fourth of four, whether in terms of goals per game or minutes per goal, in the three full seasons (plus this season) since Jovetic’s full missed season in 2010-11. (See table below). So his relative lack of goals cannot be put down to the fact that he only gets on the pitch for short times. Aguero’s record of one league goal every 113 minutes for three years is stunning; Jovetic’s tally of one every 168 minutes, including last nights two in 80, is fine but not sensational. Having said all that, Jovetic is not a main striker, he is a support striker, as much creator and provider as converter of chances. His problem will be how often he gets into the team when the others are all fit, because while he’s a decent player, he’s not a title-sealer, yet. Propping them up: Jovetic does not come out well when record over the last three seasons are compared .\n",

      "By . Sarah Harris . The head of Britain's largest teaching union NASUWT, Chris Keates, said that the cameras were stripping teachers of professionalism . Teachers are being treated like ‘lab rats’ and subjected to Big Brother-style surveillance during lessons, it has been claimed. Schools are using CCTV cameras in classrooms to ‘spy’ on staff and monitor their performance as well as check the times they arrive and leave. Some members of staff are being punished for moving chairs and interrupting colleagues’ lessons after headteachers have reviewed footage. This . ‘excessive monitoring’ comes as rising numbers of state schools across . the country are installing cameras as a safety measure. In . December, principal Neil Houchen came under fire after deciding to . install CCTV cameras in the boys' and girls’ toilets at The Eastwood . Academy, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. The . move formed part of a security crackdown on vandals and bullies, but . parents claimed it was a ‘disgusting’ invasion of privacy. More . than 200 schools across Britain are using CCTV cameras in pupils' toilets or changing rooms, according to a Big Brother Watch report two . years ago. Chris . Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, warned that teachers are also . being ‘undermined and stripped of their professionalism’. She . said: ‘Now in some schools, they are being subjected to permanent . surveillance through CCTV cameras. Lab rats have more professional . privacy.’ Around 7,500 members responded to the . union’s CCTV survey. Nearly one in ten teachers (eight per cent) reported cameras in their classrooms. Of these, 89 per cent said they could not switch off the CCTV and 88 per cent said that it was constantly recording their lessons. Over half (55 per cent) said headteachers viewed the footage and 41 per cent claimed it was being used to ‘find evidence to form negative views about staff’. While teachers acknowledged that CCTV could ‘enhance pupil and staff safety’, a third believed it was an invasion of their professional privacy. A third of teachers believed that the cameras were an invasion of their privacy. Teachers are also unable to turn off the cameras in 89 per cent of cases . Some schools are using CCTV to monitor Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) who are believed to be under-performing. One teacher surveyed said they were disciplined for visiting another colleague’s classroom – a five minute disruption that had been recorded on tape. ‘This tape was played back at least ten times by the headteacher and a note of the incident has been put on my file for a year,’ he said. Another spotted senior staff members reviewing CCTV footage in the school office. The teacher said:  ‘When I asked what my head of department was doing watching a colleague in this way she said she was trying to catch him out.’ A member of staff claimed that CCTV had been used against teachers ‘to imply they are handling a situation incorrectly even though the CCTV has no sound’. It was also used to ‘scare’ staff and to punish them, for example when chairs were moved from one ‘zone’ to another, he added. In December, principal Neil Houchen came under fire after deciding to install CCTV cameras in the boys' and girls' toilets at The Eastwood Academy, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex . A teacher said: ‘In my last school it was routinely used to see what time teachers were in class and what they were doing. It was also used to monitor leaving times.’ One teacher said they received an email from their deputy head during a maths lessons ‘asking me to inform pupils that he was watching them on CCTV’. However, a member of staff claimed that their senior management team had ‘erased CCTV when they have been caught on camera being unprofessional’. Ms Keates said: ‘In some cases, teachers reported having their private conversations filmed when the school was not in session. ‘The stories teachers recounted to us in the survey are a shocking catalogue of professional disrespect and unacceptable intrusion. ‘No other professionals are subjected to such appalling treatment. No one should be subjected to the stress and pressure of being watched constantly. ‘The NASUWT will support members in resisting such practices in schools where such abuse is taking place through all appropriate means, including industrial action.’ Members of the NASUWT will debate a motion condemning the excessive monitoring of teachers at their annual conference in Birmingham today. Last July, a report from the British Security Industry Authority (BSIA) estimated there are between 291,000 and 373,000 cameras in state schools, plus a further 30,000 to 50,000 in independent schools. Chris Keates said: 'Now in some schools, they are being subjected to permanent surveillance through CCTV cameras. Lab rats have more professional privacy'\n",

      "The accusations against the Revlon CEO are ugly -- but that doesn't mean Twitter can't pretty them up with some humor. According to the New York Post, the cosmetics company's CEO, Lorenzo Delpani, is being sued by a former company scientist, Alan Meyers, who is alleging discrimination. Meyers says in the suit that the Italian-born Delpani expressed disdain for such groups as Jews, blacks and Americans as a whole. According to the suit, Delpani said he could \"smell a black person when he entered a room,\" noted that \"Jews stick together\" and said Americans were \"small-minded\" and \"dirty.\" A Revlon representative told the Post that the suit was a product of an unhappy ex-employee. Meyers was let go because he \"repeatedly demonstrated critical lapses in judgment and failed to perform at the high standard we demand of our employees,\" she said. Revlon Chairman Ronald O. Perelman said in a statement, \"I know Lorenzo as an executive and as a person. ... He is among the least bigoted or biased human I have ever known. He has my full support.\" Nevertheless, the kerfuffle hasn't stopped wags on Twitter from making the hashtag #ShadesofRevlon trend, whether out of outrage or comic potential. \"Don't forget #ShadesOfRevlon's fragrance line: Dirty Americans perfume, Black Room cologne, & Yiddish Smell of Success. Last 2 KKK-approved!\" wrote Chris Six. \"Malcolm X-foliating cream,\" suggested Ryan Dalton. It may be a while before some customers kiss and make up with the makeup giant.

    "### DataCollatorForSeq2Seq\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataCollatorForSeq2Seq is a utility class provided by Hugging Face's transformers library, designed specifically for preparing data when fine-tuning or evaluating sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, such as T5 or BART.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its main role is to process a batch of input data (e.g., text pairs for translation, summarization, etc.) and prepare it for training or evaluation by handling tasks like padding and attention mask creation. This is crucial when using variable-length sequences in a model that requires fixed-size inputs for batched processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Functions of DataCollatorForSeq2Seq:\n",
    "Padding:\n",
    "\n",
    "In most NLP datasets, sentences have varying lengths. However, models expect all sequences in a batch to have the same length.\n",
    "DataCollatorForSeq2Seq ensures that all input and target sequences are padded to the maximum length in the batch. Padding ensures that each sequence in the batch has the same length, which is necessary for batching inputs together efficiently.\n",
    "Padding can be done dynamically (for each batch) rather than to a fixed length for the entire dataset, improving memory efficiency.\n",
    "Attention Masks:\n",
    "\n",
    "It generates attention masks that tell the model which tokens are actual input tokens and which are padding tokens. The attention mask is typically a binary mask where:\n",
    "1 represents the actual tokens.\n",
    "0 represents padding tokens.\n",
    "This helps the model distinguish between real input data and padding so it can focus on relevant parts of the sequence during training.\n",
    "Label Padding:\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequence-to-sequence tasks, both the input sequence and the output sequence (target or labels) might have different lengths. DataCollatorForSeq2Seq ensures the labels (target sequences) are also padded to the same length in a batch.\n",
    "It pads the labels with -100 instead of 0, which is the default token ID for padding. This tells the loss function (typically Cross Entropy Loss) to ignore the padded tokens when calculating the loss during training.\n",
    "Optional Use with Mixed Precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "DataCollatorForSeq2Seq can be configured to support mixed precision training by properly handling floating-point formats for improved training efficiency.\n",
    "Support for Teacher Forcing:\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequence-to-sequence models, the decoder often uses a technique called teacher forcing, where the ground truth output tokens are fed into the model during training, instead of using the model's own predictions. DataCollatorForSeq2Seq ensures that the target sequences (labels) are appropriately prepared for this during training.\n",
    "Model-Specific Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "For models like T5 or BART, which have an encoder-decoder structure, DataCollatorForSeq2Seq prepares both the input sequence (for the encoder) and the target sequence (for the decoder).\n",
    "When generating text (e.g., during evaluation), it can be configured to work with specific decoding strategies such as beam search or greedy decoding."
