      "By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 07:03 EST, 2 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 2 March 2013 . Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today. The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall. The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker. Tragic: The inquests have opened into the deaths of three members of the same family who were found in their static caravan last weekend. John and Audrey Cook are pictured . Awful: The family died following carbon monoxide poisoning at this caravan at the Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, Cornwall . It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes', . A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death. A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'. Poisoning: This woman left flowers outside the caravan following the deaths. It has emerged that the trio would have been unconscious 'within minutes' Touching: This tribute was left outside the caravan following news of the deaths . Early readings from experts at the site revealed a potentially lethal level of carbon monoxide present within the caravan at the time it was taken, shortly after the discovery of the bodies. Friends and neighbours have paid tribute to the trio. One . neighbour, Sonya Owen, 53, said: 'It's very distressing. I knew the . daughter, she was living her with her mum and dad. Everybody is really . upset.' Margaret Holmes, 65, who lived near the couple and their . daughter, said: 'They had lived here for around 40 years and they kept . themselves to themselves. 'I just can’t believe this has . happened, it is so sad and I am so shocked, I think we all are, you just . don’t expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep. 'Everyone will miss them, we used to chat a lot when we were both in the garden. 'I would just like to send my condolences to their family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through.' Nic Clark, 52, who was good friends with daughter Maureen, added: 'They were a lovely kind family, a great trio. 'Maureen . used to go out and walk her dog, a little Jack Russell, it is so sad . what has happened, I understand the dog went with them. 'They . will be sorely missed and I think everyone is just in shock at the . moment, I would like to send my condolences to the Cook family.'\n",

      "UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- A rare meeting of U.N. Security Council heads of state, led for the first time by a U.S. president, adopted a resolution focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons Thursday. President Obama is the first U.S. leader to head a United Nations Security Council meeting. President Obama challenged the gathering -- which included leaders of nuclear powers including Russia, China, Great Britain and France -- to overcome cynicism against the goal of ridding the planet of nuclear arms. \"We harbor no illusions about the difficulty of bringing about a world without nuclear weapons,\" Obama said, adding that Thursday's meeting signaled a significant step forward in cooperative global action. The resolution, which was adopted unanimously, calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent them from being used for military purposes or stolen. It also encourages enforcement of international treaties and U.N. resolutions regarding nuclear non-proliferation, particularly when nations such as Iran and North Korea are in violation. \"The world must stand together,\" Obama said. \"We must demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise.\" It was the first Security Council summit chaired by a U.S. president, and only the fifth time that Security Council heads of state have met. Obama led the meeting because the United States holds the revolving presidency of the Security Council in September. Both Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, who spoke later, said the world's two nuclear superpowers were working on reducing their stockpiles in advance of a global nuclear summit scheduled for next year. \"It's obvious that an effective solution ... depends on the constructive engagement of all parties,\" Medvedev said, adding that he expected the Russia-U.S. leadership on the issue to be backed by \"all nuclear powers.\" The measure passed Thursday -- Security Council resolution 1887 -- calls for \"locking down vulnerable nuclear weapons materials in four years\" while minimizing civilian use of weapons-grade uranium. It encourages full compliance with all international treaties and resolutions on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including Security Council resolutions that cite North Korea and Iran for failing to adhere to international commitments. In addition, the resolution supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy, a theme backed by Chinese President Hu Jintao. China seeks to expand its nuclear energy capacity as part of an economic development plan that holds down greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown also cited the role of nuclear power as a clean energy source that should be part of the solution to global warming affecting every nation. Brown and other leaders spoke of the need to prevent nuclear weapons or the materials to make them from ending up in the hands of terrorist groups. \"The biggest risk the world faces today is of extremists getting hold of nuclear materials,\" said Mohammad ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who criticized the Security Council on Wednesday in a rambling speech to the U.N. General Assembly, was absent for the meeting. In Libya's turn to speak at the summit, its special representative to the United Nations called for the IAEA to inspect all nuclear programs, including Israel's, instead of focusing on non-nuclear states. Asked later about Gadhafi's absence, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Libya could serve as an example to Iran and North Korea as a nation that gave up its nuclear weapons program and now had rejoined the full international community. \"I think the message that the Libyans had at the Security Council is a message that we hope that the Iranians and the North Koreans will take to heart, and that is giving up a nuclear weapons program and the benefits that it can have for international cooperation and for their reintegration into an international community,\" Gibbs said. Brown earlier called for sanctions against Iran for its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. On Wednesday, Medvedev signaled that Russia -- which previously has opposed such move -- also could support sanctions against Iran. \"Russia's position is clear: sanctions rarely lead to productive results, but in some cases sanctions are inevitable,\" Medvedev said in a joint appearance with Obama after they met in New York. The statement bolsters U.S.-led efforts for increased international pressure on Iran to adhere to nonproliferation agreements in pursuing the development of nuclear energy. Iran claims its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability. The Iranian mission to the United Nations released a statement after the Security Council meeting, saying the country's nuclear activities \"are and always have been, for peaceful purposes, and, therefore, pose no threat whatsoever.\" \"In practicing its legitimate right to develop nuclear energy technology, Iran has always maintained its need for nuclear power as an alternative source of energy to supply its booming population and rapid development. ... Our commitment to nonproliferation remains intact,\" the statement added. The United States and Russia previously have disagreed over Iran, and over possible steps the Security Council may take -- including imposing sanctions -- to push Tehran to comply with U.N. demands concerning its nuclear program. Last week, Obama announced that the United States was dropping plans to base a missile defense shield system in Poland and the Czech Republic, a proposal that had rankled Moscow. He has denied the change was directly linked to Russia's position regarding sanctions on Iran, but said any Russian shift in that direction would be a bonus.\n",

      "Cover-up: Former Archbishop Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, a judge's report claims . A former archbishop who failed to act on alleged crimes of a paedophile priest should be jailed, the abuser’s victims have said. Lord Hope, the former Archbishop of York, did not act on 19 occasions when allegations of abuse or inappropriate conduct by the priest were raised with him, a scathing report revealed yesterday. But despite that, Lord Hope remains as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Bradford. Eli Ward and Bim Atkinson, who were among seven victims of the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, former Dean of Manchester, said it is ‘incredible’ that the man who did nothing to stop the priest has been allowed to keep his post. The report by Judge Sally Cahill QC said Lord Hope failed to act because his ‘concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount’. Waddington, who kept an official position in the church until 2005 and died in 2007, targeted young choirboys over several decades. One of the seven victims committed suicide in 1989. Mr Atkinson, 59, who was abused when Waddington was a priest in Australia in the 1960s, sent a picture of disgraced Tory peer Lord Archer, who was jailed for perjury, to the Bishop of North Queensland Bill Ray, adding: ‘I would be pushing for Lord Hope to be treated in the same way as this fellow.’ Mr Ward, now 41, was abused by Waddington between the ages of 11 and 15 as a chorister at Manchester Cathedral. He said: ‘It’s just incredible Lord Hope still has a position. Here is a guy who shoved it all under the carpet. 'He failed and failed to do anything and yet nothing has happened to him. He is still allowed to sit in the House of Lords.’ He added: ‘I’d like to see him punished. My opinion is that he’s committed a crime, perverting the course of justice, and should face the consequences.’ Robert Waddington died in 2007 - he had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 . Mr Ward said he left the choir when he was 15 after church officials became concerned – but the priest was allowed to remain as the dean in charge of the cathedral until 1993. Waddington then moved to York Minster, where more children were abused. He stayed in a lesser post there until 2005, despite the allegations made to Lord Hope, according to the report, which was commissioned by current Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu. Mr Ward said: ‘Here we had a church body which had been preaching at us to be morally correct yet, when it came to doing the same thing themselves, they were incapable.’ Mr Ward, now living in the Home Counties with a long-term girlfriend, added that he has put the abuse behind him. But he believes Waddington’s abuse was responsible for the death of another victim, a former chorister from Carlisle named in the report only as Peter, who was abused in the 1970s, developed depression and schizophrenia, and committed suicide in 1989. Lord Hope, 76, has described Judge Cahill’s report as ‘flawed’ but offered a ‘personal and profound apology’. He said: ‘This report makes it clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover-up. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’\n",

    "\n",
    "The DataCollatorForSeq2Seq is a utility class provided by Hugging Face's transformers library, designed specifically for preparing data when fine-tuning or evaluating sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, such as T5 or BART.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its main role is to process a batch of input data (e.g., text pairs for translation, summarization, etc.) and prepare it for training or evaluation by handling tasks like padding and attention mask creation. This is crucial when using variable-length sequences in a model that requires fixed-size inputs for batched processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Functions of DataCollatorForSeq2Seq:\n",
    "Padding:\n",
    "\n",
    "In most NLP datasets, sentences have varying lengths. However, models expect all sequences in a batch to have the same length.\n",
    "DataCollatorForSeq2Seq ensures that all input and target sequences are padded to the maximum length in the batch. Padding ensures that each sequence in the batch has the same length, which is necessary for batching inputs together efficiently.\n",
    "Padding can be done dynamically (for each batch) rather than to a fixed length for the entire dataset, improving memory efficiency.\n",
    "Attention Masks:\n",
    "\n",
    "It generates attention masks that tell the model which tokens are actual input tokens and which are padding tokens. The attention mask is typically a binary mask where:\n",
    "1 represents the actual tokens.\n",
    "0 represents padding tokens.\n",
    "This helps the model distinguish between real input data and padding so it can focus on relevant parts of the sequence during training.\n",
    "Label Padding:\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequence-to-sequence tasks, both the input sequence and the output sequence (target or labels) might have different lengths. DataCollatorForSeq2Seq ensures the labels (target sequences) are also padded to the same length in a batch.\n",
    "It pads the labels with -100 instead of 0, which is the default token ID for padding. This tells the loss function (typically Cross Entropy Loss) to ignore the padded tokens when calculating the loss during training.\n",
    "Optional Use with Mixed Precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "DataCollatorForSeq2Seq can be configured to support mixed precision training by properly handling floating-point formats for improved training efficiency.\n",
    "Support for Teacher Forcing:\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequence-to-sequence models, the decoder often uses a technique called teacher forcing, where the ground truth output tokens are fed into the model during training, instead of using the model's own predictions. DataCollatorForSeq2Seq ensures that the target sequences (labels) are appropriately prepared for this during training.\n",
    "Model-Specific Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "For models like T5 or BART, which have an encoder-decoder structure, DataCollatorForSeq2Seq prepares both the input sequence (for the encoder) and the target sequence (for the decoder).\n",
    "When generating text (e.g., during evaluation), it can be configured to work with specific decoding strategies such as beam search or greedy decoding."

      "Major studies of Albert Einstein’s work contain minimal, if any, reference to the role of German mathematician Emmy Noether. Yet, she was crucial in resolving a paradox in general relativity through her theorem connecting symmetry and energy-conservation laws, published in 1918. When Noether died in 1935, Einstein called her “the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced since the higher education of women began”. In this book about her for the general reader, physicist Lee Phillips brings Noether alive.\n",

      "\n",
      "Some 40,000 measures taking effect range from sweeping, national mandates under Obamacare to marijuana legalization in Colorado, drone prohibition in Illinois and transgender protections in California.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although many new laws are controversial, they made it through legislatures, public referendum or city councils and represent the shifting composition of American beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal: Health care, of course, and vending machines\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest and most politically charged change comes at the federal level with the imposition of a new fee for those adults without health insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine.\n",

      "Oregon: Family leave in Oregon has been expanded to allow eligible employees two weeks of paid leave to handle the death of a family member.\n",

      "\n",
      "Illinois and drones\n",
      "\n",
      "Illinois: passed two laws limiting the use of drones. One prohibits them from interfering with hunters and fisherman. The measure passed after the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said it would use drones to monitor hunters. PETA said it aims through its “air angels” effort to protect against “cruel” and “illegal” hunting.\n",

      "While most amount to less than 15 cents per hour, workers in places like New Jersey, and Connecticut.\n",
      "\n",
      "New Jersey residents voted to raise the state’s minimum wage by $1 to $8.25 per hour. And in Connecticut, lawmakers voted to raise it between 25 and 75 cents to $8.70. The wage would go up to $8 in Rhode Island and New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "California is also raising its minimum wage to $9 per hour, but workers must wait until July to see the addition.\n",
      "\n",

Some of the biggest winners in Q3 were coding assistant Magic ($320 million in August) And $2.9 billion of that funding went to U.S.-based companies across 127 deals. Experts question the tech’s reliability, and — in the case of generative AI models trained on copyrighted data without permission — its legality.\n",
